   <h2> <p>Real Madrid Club de Fútbol<br><audio></h2>
        <audio src="Real_Madrid.ogg.mp3"></audio>Commonly referred to as Real
    Madrid, is a football club based in Madrid, Spain. The club competes in La Liga, the top tier of Spanish football.</p><br>
    
    <p>Founded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has traditionally worn a white home kit. The honorific title real is
    Spanish for "royal" and was given by King Alfonso XIII in 1920, as well as the crown being added to the club crest. Real
    Madrid have played their home matches in the 85,000-capacity. Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid since 1947. Unlike
    most European football clubs, Real Madrid's members (socios) have owned and operated the club throughout its history.
    Its anthem is the "Hala Madrid y nada más". The club is one of the most widely supported in the world, is the most
    followed football club on social media, and was estimated to be worth $6.6 billion in 2024, making it the
    world's most valuable football club. In 2024, Madrid became the first football club to make €1 billion ($1.1bn) in
    revenue.<br></p>
    
    In domestic football, the club have won 71 trophies: a record 36 La Liga titles, 20 Copa del Rey, 13 Supercopa de
    España, a Copa Eva Duarte, and a Copa de la Liga. In international football, Real Madrid have won a record 34
    trophies: a record 15 European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles, a record six UEFA Super Cups, two UEFA Cups, a joint
    record two Latin Cups, a record one Iberoamerican Cup, and a record eight FIFA Club World championships. Real
    Madrid was ranked first in the International Federation of Football History & Statistics Club World Ranking for 2000,
    2002, 2014, 2017. In UEFA, Madrid ranks first in the all-time club ranking.<br><br><br>
    
    Madrid is one of the three La Liga clubs alongside Barcelona and Athletic Bilbao that have never been relegated from the
    top division since its inception in 1929. Real Madrid have many long-standing rivalries, most notably the El Clásico
    with Barcelona and El Derbi Madrileño with Atlético Madrid. The club established itself as a major force in Spanish and
    European football during the 1950s and 60s, winning five consecutive and a total six European Cups as well as two
    reaching two finals. This success was replicated domestically, with Madrid winning 12 league titles in 16 years. This
    team, which included Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás, Paco Gento, and Raymond Kopa is considered by many to be the
    greatest of all time. Real Madrid is known for its Galácticos policy, which involves signing the world's best
    players, such as Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane and David Beckham to create a superstar team. The policy generally refers
    to the two eras of Florentino Pérez's presidency (2000–06 and 2009–18); however, some players before his tenure are
    considered to be Galácticos, such as Steve McManaman.[24] In June 2009, Madrid signed Cristiano Ronaldo for a
    record-breaking £80 million (€94 million); he became the all-time top goalscorer for the club and in
    football. Madrid have recently relaxed the Galácticos policy, instead focusing on signing young talents
    such as Vinícius Júnior, Rodrygo, Jude Bellingham, and Kylian Mbappé.<br><br><br>
    
    Real Madrid are recognised as the greatest football club of the 20th century by FIFA and as the best European club
    during the same timeframe by the IFFHS. They also received the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit in 2004. Real
    Madrid have the highest participations in the European Cup/Champions League , in which they hold the records for
    the most wins and the most goals scored. Real Madrid is the only club to have won three consecutive titles
    (three-peat) in the European Cup/Champions League twice, the first time in 1955–56, 1956–57, and 1957–58, and the second
    time in 2015–16, 2016–17 and 2017–18. In June 2024, they won a record-extending 15th Champions League title (the fifth
    title in nine seasons), recognised as such by Guinness World Records. Real Madrid is the first club across all of
    Europe's top-five leagues to win 100 trophies in all competitions. As of July 2024, Real Madrid are ranked 2nd in
    the UEFA club rankings and ranked first in the last decade (2013–2023).<br><br><br>

    Early years (1902–1943)<br><br><br>
    
    Julián Palacios, the first president of the club in 1900–1902
    Real Madrid's origins go back to when football was introduced to Madrid by the academics and students of the Institución
    Libre de Enseñanza, which included several Cambridge and Oxford University graduates.[40] They founded (Sociedad) Sky
    Football in 1897, commonly known as La Sociedad (The Society) as it was the only one based in Madrid, playing on Sunday
    mornings at Moncloa.<br><br><br>
    
    In 1900, conflict between members caused some of them to leave and create a new club, Nueva Sociedad de Football (New
    Society of Football), to distinguish themselves from Sky Football. Among the dissenters were Julián Palacios, recognized
    as the first Real Madrid president, Juan Padrós and Carlos Padrós, the latter two being brothers and future presidents
    of Real Madrid. In 1901, this new club was renamed as Madrid Football Club. Later, following a restructuring in 1902,
    Sky was renamed as "New Foot-Ball Club".[41][42][43]<br><br><br>
    
    On 6 March 1902, after a new Board presided by Juan Padrós had been elected, Madrid Football Club was officially
    founded.[7] The Padrós brothers summoned other football enthusiasts to a meeting in the back room of Al Capricho, the
    family business. They viewed football as a mass sport that should be accessible to representatives of all social
    classes, and thought the new club should embody that idea. The brothers proposed the name, Madrid Football Club, which
    was unanimously accepted. The membership fee was also set, two pesetas a month, and the color of the shirt was chosen to
    be white in honour of a famous English team Corinthian, which Juan Padrós had met on one of his trips.[44][45]<br><br><br>
    
    
    Madrid FC team in 1906
    Three years after its founding, in 1905, Madrid FC won its first title after defeating Athletic Bilbao in the Spanish
    Cup final. The club became one of the founding sides of the Royal Spanish Football Federation on 4 January 1909, when
    club president Adolfo Meléndez signed the foundation agreement of the Spanish FA. After moving between several grounds,
    the team relocated to the Campo de O'Donnell in 1912.[46] In 1920, the club's name was changed to Real Madrid after King
    Alfonso XIII granted the title of Real (Royal) to the club.[47]<br><br><br>
    
    In 1929, the first Spanish football league was founded. Real Madrid led the first league season until the last match, a
    loss to Athletic Bilbao, meant they finished runners-up to Barcelona.[48] Real Madrid won its first league title in the
    1931–32 season and retained it the following year.[49]<br><br><br>
    
    On 14 April 1931, the arrival of the Second Spanish Republic caused the club to lose the title Real and the royal crown
    on its emblem, going back to being named Madrid Football Club until the end of the Spanish Civil War. Football continued
    during the Second World War, and on 13 June 1943, Madrid beat Barcelona 11–1 in the second leg of the Copa del
    Generalísimo semi-finals, the Spanish Cup having been renamed in honour of General Franco.[note 2][50]<br><br><br>
    
    The first leg, played at the Les Corts in Catalonia, had ended with Barcelona winning 3–0. Madrid complained about all
    the three goals that referee Fombona Fernández had allowed for Barcelona,[51] with the home supporters also whistling
    Madrid throughout, whom they accused of employing roughhouse tactics, and Fombona for allowing them to. The newspaper Ya
    reported the whistling as a "clear intention to attack the representatives of Spain."[52] Barcelona fans were banned
    from traveling to Madrid. The day of the second leg, the Barcelona team were insulted and stones were thrown at their
    bus as soon as they left their hotel.<br><br><br>
